To fit a reduced model that contains only the response variable and the intercept, you can use the `glm()` function in R with the formula `y ~ 1`, where `y` is the name of your response variable. This will estimate the intercept parameter, which is the log-odds of the response when all the predictors are zero. You can also use the `summary()` function to see the coefficient, standard error, z-value, and p-value of the intercept.

For example, suppose you have a dataset called `data` with a binary response variable called `y` and two predictor variables called `x1` and `x2`. You can fit the full model and the reduced model as follows:

```r
# Fit the full model
model_full <- glm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, family = binomial)

# Fit the reduced model
model_reduced <- glm(y ~ 1, data = data, family = binomial)

# See the summary of the reduced model
summary(model_reduced)
```

The output will show something like this:

```r
Call:
glm(formula = y ~ 1, family = binomial, data = data)

Deviance Residuals: 
    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max

Residual deviance: 138.63  on 99  degrees of freedom
AIC: 140.63

Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
```

This means that the intercept is estimated to be -0.6931, which corresponds to a probability of 0.3333 for the response variable. The p-value of the intercept is very small, which indicates that it is significantly different from zero.

You can also compare the full model and the reduced model using a likelihood ratio test, as explained in [this article](^4^).
